# Author Intrusion - Part of Speech Tagging (Node.js)

**This is a dead-end in terms of development but it left for historical reasons. There will be no further development here.**

[Author Intrusion](https://authorintrusion.com/) is a set of tools and libraries used to create an IDE-like environment for writers. It is focused less on user-friendly UIs and more toward static configuration files, such as typically found in programming frameworks (such as `package.json` for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) packages).

This package, `node-author-intrusion-pos-tagger`, is a plugin to tag tokens with parts of speech. This allows other plugins to process based on the POS tags in addition to the split. It requires the lines to be split into individual tokens before calling.

For the core Author Intrusion functionality, see [node-author-intrusion-service](https://github.com/author-intrusion/node-author-intrusion-service) and [node-author-intrusion-cli](https://github.com/author-intrusion/node-author-intrusion-cli).
